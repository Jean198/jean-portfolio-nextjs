            <h2>I'm Jean Niyigaba,</h2>
            <p>
            I have a masterâ€™s degree in computational engineering and my passion
            is coding and developing Web Applications. <br />  
            I have worked as trainee software developer at Softrain Blobs Oy where I rewrote a big part of their transportation <br />
             software with modern web technologies  including React and Nodejs. <br /><br />
                I am looking for an internship or an entry level role to work and improve my skills.
